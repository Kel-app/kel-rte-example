# RTE Example

This is a working example of the Kel RTE component.

## Getting Started

This was made using bun.sh, so you'll need to install bun first.

see [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) for more info

Install dependencies with

```bash
bun install
```

Then you can run the app with:

```bash
bun dev
```

All default next.js configs are applied, so you will find the app running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
